<h1>SELFIE PROJECT</h1>
<img src="images/LAXAN_JOSE_SELFIE_PXL600.png.jpg" alt="my selfie project" width="400px"/>
<p>This project showcases a selfie of me surrounded by objects that are dear to me. As you can see, I am from India and my favorite sport is soccer. I have a passion for acting and enjoy performing in movies and plays. Additionally, you can observe a depiction of Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, who is a character that I adore from the Indian epic Ramayana.
